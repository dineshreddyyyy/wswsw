<div>The inherent support of global HC standards should also be an a priori characteristic
of an Application Framework for HIS. Roughly analogous to the need of supporting HC
standards within a HC application framework is the need of supporting for example ODBC
or the SOAP within a RAD: it’s inconceivable not to; try to imagine for example someone
that uses Microsoft’s Visual studio, having to read and implement the SOAP! In reality,
that means that the developer will be exhausted by SOAP technicalities missing the
business process details. Kuhn and Giuse (2002, p.65) refer to Regenstrief medical record
system (one of the success stories in health informatics) and to the developers’ statement
that: “we believe that our success represents persistent efforts to build interfaces
directly to multiple independent instruments and other data collection systems, using
medical standards such as HL7, LOINC, and DICOM”. So, from the developers’ point of
view (who will be the actual users of such a framework) it is clear that it is more than
enviable to have handy HC standards implementations.<br>
    
The same stands for IT standards and interoperable protocols. Actually, once more as
Kuhn and Giuse (2002, p. 72) summarize, “…the broad acceptance of web standards such
as XML has led to their integration into the ongoing standardization process”.<br>
Using frameworks in order to provide applications offers significant benefits. Applications can extend and specialize extension points—-called “hot spots” as mentioned by
Markiewicz and Lucena (2001)—provided by the framework, according to their special
needs (Johnson, 1997). The modularity, reusability, extensibility and inversion of control
that a framework offers can encapsulate an amount of complexity that framework clients
(applications) can reuse (Fayad & Schmidt, 1997). In such a scenario as Fayad and Hamu
explains (2000), applications are built on top of frameworks, which provide an extensive
library of business objects supporting the intended application domain and use its
services. The use of frameworks can reduce the overall cost of creation and maintenance
of a health-related application. This cost is enormous because of the special requirements
of HC, namely increased security, interoperability, extensibility, portability, and the
ability to evolve. Application frameworks can effectively handle these aspects. The
development of a framework is generally more expensive than a single application but can
payoff through the repeated generation of applications within the proposed domain as
Markiewicz and Lucena say (2001).<br>
Besides the above benefits from application frameworks, it’s significant to note another
side-effect of adopting frameworks in application development: Most times, the use of
a framework denotes the use of an Information Model or something analogous, since the
framework is not an ad-hoc development result. That means that at the end, we will have
a repository of business objects definitions or at least, a formal description of concepts.
That is very critical in order to translate between different ontologies. In case this “formal
description of concepts” originates from the middleware of common services (possible
as a common service itself), it can even result in consistently merging the ontologies
used. Although using reference models for realizing the middleware of common services
layer is a common place that is not the case when it comes to the applications located
in the applications layer.<br>
An application framework providing a clear description of the underlying data structures
as well as built-in validity and consistency rules for data verification can also help reduce
data entry errors and minimize the excessive cost of cleaning medical databases for
    knowledge discovery purposes. Krzystof (2001) claims that data preparation for any</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>knowledge discovery process usually consumes at least half the entire project effort and
is a major contributor to its cost. This situation is even more challenging for medical
databases that are characterized by incomplete, imprecise and inconsistent data, as data
collection is usually a by-product of the primary patient care activities. Decision support
systems are powerful tools for improving medical decision making and preventing
medical errors. It is reported that medical errors are a leading cause of death, while the
majority of adverse events that contribute to patient morbidity or mortality are preventable. Decision support systems can help reduce medical errors by questioning the
actions of healthcare professionals, offering advice and examining a range of possibilities that humans cannot possibly remember (Kohn, Corrigan, & Donaldson, 1999). The
accuracy of developed decision support systems depends heavily on the precision and
correctness of the available data and the sufficient modelling of the underlying domain
concepts.<br>
While the technical advantages of application frameworks are sufficiently covered by
literature, their business perspective is largely neglected. It is reported that the adaptive
nature of application frameworks enables flexible response to new and rapidly changing
market opportunities, making a framework a strategic tool for attacking vertical markets
(Codenie, De Hondt, Steyaert, & Vercammen, 1997). Return on investment from a
developed application framework may come from selling it to other companies or by future
savings in development effort within a company itself, such as higher software quality
and shorter lead times (Fayad, Schmidt, & Johnson, 1999).<br>
Although business opportunities from developing a framework may be intuitive, the lack
of a reliable business model for framework development has made management departments reluctant to adopt framework-based solutions. The Value Based Reuse Investment
(VBRI) approach (Fayad et al., 1999) tries to fill the gap and views reuse investments as
a continuous process of formulating strategic options and then evaluating them with
respect to their potential for value creation. It also suggests that the “potential of</div>

    <div>application framework technology for value creation can only be realized if it is exploited
at all levels of the Reuse Capability Model” and not only at the lower levels of the model,
such as at the level of individual projects, which is already practiced by many organizations worldwide. This means that reuse should be employed at an organization-wide level
and over multiple projects. Moreover, reuse strategies should take into account families
of related products and create new business opportunities in a rapidly changing market
environment.</div>

    <h2>Developing an Application<br>
Framework for HIS<br>_____________________________________________________</h2>
    <div>For the last two years, the authors of this document have toiled developing an application
framework for HC domain (Framework.Health) able to be integrated within Microsoft’s
Visual Studio .Net.<br><br>
The framework provides all the software modules needed for the handling of dynamically
defined and reusable HC business objects (e.g., patient demographics, diagnoses,
exams). The built-in infrastructure of the framework includes an XML metadata layer and
the base services layer (see Figure 2).<br>
The XML metadata layer provides a common domain concept repository that allows the
semantic interoperability among the application tiers and supports all operations
performed by the base services layer. The HC business objects populating the domain
concept repository are derived from HL7 v 2.4 standard entities. These concepts, along
with business rules, operational workflow and user interface design, are not hard-coded
into the applications, but maintained externally into the XML metadata layer. This layer
also defines a set of XML languages for formally describing data types, data structures
and messages, as well as user interface behavior and application workflows that are
        needed to build the data and software model.</div><br>
    
    <div>The base services layer exposes all the functionality needed for building HC
applications, namely:</div>
    
    
<div>1.      The data persistence services provide a uniform and flexible way of accessing the
underlying data storage. The data model is explicitly derived from the business
objects described in XML resource files (e.g., a relational database schema is
generated dynamically from these files). Any changes to the business objects are
easily incorporated into the data model implementation. Moreover, the framework
provides a set of software libraries for accessing the data storage, which accelerate
the application development and provide a uniform and reliable way of communicating with the data storage tier.<br>
2.     The framework provides a set of libraries that aid the construction and manipulation
of business entities using an object-oriented programming language. These
libraries make use of the metadata layer to create the appropriate structure for each</div>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div>entity that the application uses and provide a common interface for the manipulation of the data stored in these structures, (e.g., HL7 segments and data types are
instantiated as objects). These libraries also provide coupling with the data
persistence services.<br>
3.    The messaging services include XML-based message definition, message creation
and validation. The framework provides a solid infrastructure for secure message
transfer, as well as message processing and persistence tools. A specific messaging implementation is provided for HL7 v2.4 messages.<br>
4.    Adaptive user interface construction involves all the mechanisms for user interface definition through the use of XML and dynamic UI creation based on the XML
description files. One can find a complete discussion of the used approach in
(Marinos, Marinos & Koutsouris, 2003).</div>
    
    <div>The overall framework architecture consists of three distinct parts: the Data Model, the
Controller and the Presentation Layer. The architecture is depicted on Figure 3.
Data Model. The framework provides a reference implementation of the HL7 standard
data model. This model includes data types, segments (a logical grouping of data fields)
and messages (the atomic units of data transferred between systems); please refer to
(HL7 version 2.5, 2003) for a consist definition of the terms “data types”, “segments” and
“messages”. These entities are not hard-coded into the framework, but externally defined
in XML format. Figure 4 shows the XML definition of the CE (Coded Element) HL7 data type.
Similar definitions apply to segments and messages and are customizable according to
each specific implementation (e.g., according to HL7 conformance profiles). Figure 5
shows an example of a segment definition.
XML definitions also describe the mapping of such entities to database schema elements,
as shown in Figure 6. The elements and attributes of the XML fragment shown on Figure
6, instruct some specialized framework components on how to create the database</div>

    <div>schema and how to map business entities to database tables during query and transaction activities. E.g. the link=”true” directive advises the framework that the PatientName
field of the PID segment is not saved in the PID_TABLE table, but is stored in the table
reserved for the XPN data type (the field’s data type).<br>
The Data Model tier contains also the actual processing units that handle message
content, called Action handlers. These are autonomous software modules that use the
base services functionality and may produce new messages that respond to initial
requests or notify interested parties about a system event.<br>
Controller. The Controller module receives and processes all ingoing/outgoing messages. The Controller implements a messaging pipeline using the SOAP protocol, where
messages are processed at each node of the Pipeline and forwarded to the next node.
This involves authentication and authorization of the message sender, logging and
tracing of all message flow within the system, applying business rules and dispatching
the messages to the appropriate Action handlers.<br>
The Pipeline is fully configurable through an XML configuration file. For example,
additional processing nodes can be added (e.g., a message compression/decompression</div>
